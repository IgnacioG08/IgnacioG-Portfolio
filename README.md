# Ignacio Gamez Portfolio

## Description
This page should be utilized to illustrate my employment portfolio to any and all possible employers seeking to hire me based on what they see here.
The page contains a short description of myself and showcases some of my work completed. Mind you this is the beginning of my training and by the end of this year should contain far more work and a higher caliber of work. Nonetheless here you will find my work based at the current level I am working in. Also at the bottom you will find a contact me page without any real information which will be updated as time passes. If you minimize the page and play with the different pixels you will see my page will respond to it to ensure that mobile users can see this portfolio  as well. Thanks for looking!
