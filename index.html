                            <hr>
                        </strong><br>
                        My name is Ignacio and I am a student of web development. I am currently located in San
                        Bernardino County where I have spent most of my
                        life. What motivates me to become a developer is the increasing need for such individuals in the
                        workforce. Not only is it in demand but
                        it is also quite entertaining. My goals as a student of web and application development are to
                        obtain a career in which I can say I not
                        only enjoy but am also proud to do daily. My career up until now has mostly been related to the
                        warehousing industry but as I stated I
                        am now seeking to develop skills to better my path.
